I copied all the files from the first calculator circleci assignment and then followed the instructions on "https://circleci.com/docs/slack-orb-tutorial/#use-message-templates" to get the slack messaging system to work.

Had some debugging.  Followed the rabit holes the error messages sent me on and eventually got it to work properly.
